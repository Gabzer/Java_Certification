## Compile, Package, and Execute Non-Modular Java Applications

Well, we'll start by looking at how non-modular job applications are deployed. So before Version 9 of Java, before modules were introduced, what it is that you do to deploy the application. Well, first, of course, you need to compile code, right? So Java, Java compiler. And what do you do to compile is that you set up the class path that points to where your classes are, were any other libraries where they're supposed to be. Then you point to the folder where you want to store the compiled output and where you want to grab sources from. So that's your compilation process.
A jar file is look like a zip file.

## Non-Modular Java Characteristics

Packages provided logical grouping of classes;
Packages did not impose physical restricitions on how they are used;
Classes are packaged into jar files and accessed via classpath;
Common deployment of related classes is not enforced;
Visibility of classes is controlled with public and default access modifiers;
Encapssulation can always be bypassed using reflection;
```java
Class c = Class.forName("a.Y");
Field[] fields = c.getFields();
Method[] methods = c.getMethods();
```
Impossible to restrict in which exact other packages your code can be used.

## What is a Module ?

**Module is a high-level code aggregation** that is comprised of one or more closely related packages and possibly other resources that you may decide to include into the module. So you think about a group of packages, which are sort of always used together or closely related. And that's your module. You aggregate them.
Each module is described with a Java class called **module-info**, which is stored in a root folder of the module.
So module says which are the modules it wants to use. And also, the modules describe explicitly which exact code out of this module is allowed to be used by other modules. And you can actually specify by which other modules.

```java
module <this_module_name> {
    requires <other_module_names>;
    exports <packages_of_this_module_to_other_modules_that_require_them>;
    opens <packages_of_this_module_to_other_modules_via_reflection>;
    uses <services_provided_by_other_modules>;
    provides <services_to_other_modules> with <service_implementations>;
    version <value>;
}
```

## Java Platform Module System (JPMS)

Now, modular system-- Java Platform Modular System-- has been introduced in JDK 9, and the entire Java Development Kit itself has been repackaged as modules. So now, all the standard JDK APIs are also modularized. So as they say, the modules are packed in the archive. Each module has a descriptor, which is the module info.
**You need to have a module-info file per module**.
Remember, module is a group of packages.
Another interesting thing is that with module path **application starts quicker**. And the reason behind it is when you need to load class into memory, with a class path, you don't know which exact archive that class is in, because there is no requirement. And there is no guarantee that classes from the same package are in the same archive.

## JPMS Module Categories

Java SE Modules:
1.Core Java platform for general-purpose APIs;
2.Module names start with "java".

JDK Modules:
1.Additional implementation-specific modules;
2.Module names start with "jdk".

Other Modules:
1.Create your own and use third-party modules.

**java --list-modules** to list existing set of modules.




# Part 2

## Define Module Dependencies

**requires** - That means that you want to use classes from another module.
**requires transitive** - So you are saying, I need that module, and anybody who needs me, they'll need that module as well.
**requires static** - you can say that you need that module at compile time, but actually you don't insist on that module being present at runtime.

Directive **requires java.base** is implied for all modules.

## Export Module Content

**exports** directive specifies packages whose public types should be accessible to all other modules.
**exports <packages> to <other_modules>** restricts exported packages to a list of specific modules.

## Open Module Content

The primary difference between opens and exports is that, when you use the opens directive, you allow the contents of a certain package to be used, including the use through a reflection API.

**opens** directive specifies package whose entire content is accessible to all other modules at run time.
**opens <packages> to <other_modules>** restricts opened package to a list of specific modules.

## Produce and Consume Services

**provides <service_interface> with <classes>** directive specifies that module provides one or more service implementations that can be _dynamically discovered by service consumer_.
**uses <service_interface>** directive specifies an interface or an abstract class that defines a service that this module would like to consume.




# Part 3

## Multi-Release Module Archives

One more feature that you could use with modular archives is versions. So you can compile your code and place it into the archive several times with versions, and then a version number subfolders. So you can have a subfolder for each version of Java Development Kit. Generally speaking, that's not really required.

```
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Multi-Release: true
```

## Compile and Package a Module

Compile Module:

```bash
javac --module-path <paths to other modules>
      -d <complied output folder>
      -sourcepath <path to source code>
```

Package module into a JAR file:

```bash
jar --create -f <path and anme of the jar file>
    --main-class <package name>.<main class name>
    -C <path to complied module code>
```

Verify packaged module:

```bash
java --module-path <path to complied module>
     --describe-module <module name>
```

## Execute a Modularized Application

```bash
java -p <path to modules>
     -m <module name>/<package name>.<main class name> <arguments>
```

## Migrating Legacy Java Applications Using Automatic Modules

META-INF/MANIFEST.MF

```
Automatic-Module_name: <JAR file name>
```

## Create Custom Runtime Image

Use **jlink** utility to create custom runtime image.
Once again, if you don't have modular JARs, you can't use jlink.

```bash
jlink --module-path <path to complied modules and %JAVA_HOME/jmods folder>
      --add-modules <list of module names>
      --bind-services
      --launcher <command name>=<module name>
      --output <name of the runtime image>
```

Java runtime image actually contains inside Java runtime. It's embedded into the runtime image. It contains the configuration and the code of your application and any other modules you would like to use in a lib folder. That will be whatever modules you'd like to use, right? And it's essentially a self-contained application. You can distribute this application to another machine, and you don't need to install a separate Java runtime on that machine. You don't. Everything you need is inside the JIMAGE. So it can run on another machine without actual prior installation of Java runtime.
It will only contain the subset which is actually required to run your application.
Your application deployment footprint with a JIMAGE becomes dramatically **smaller**.
**--launcher** - you may optionally designate launcher. Launcher is like a shell script, like a shortcut, via which you can launch your application. So kind of alias, yeah? Which triggers the application to run.

Examine JIMAGE:

```bash
<image>/bin/java -version
<image>/bin/java --list-modules
```

## Execute Runtime Image

```bash
<image>/bin/java -m <module name or launcher name>
# or
<image>/bin/<module name or launcher name>
```
