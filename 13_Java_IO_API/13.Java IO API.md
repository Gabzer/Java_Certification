# Part 1

## Java Input-Output Principals

The concept of what Input-Output API actually represents, it's the API that allows us to read or write information. Reading means getting information from some source. Reading is the input direction. Writing is delivering information to destination-- to a particular target. That's the output direction.
The transfer of the information is managed by Java classes that we categorize as streams. **Streams** data streams-- just information, which is like text or binary data. So we categorize this as input-output streams.
What these streams can do is apply extra processing to the data.

## Java Input-Output API

java.io and java.nio
There are **InputStream**, **OutputStream**, **Reader**, and **Writer**. So these are four top-level classes for which the rest of the IO API descends.
InputReader represents the input direction-- reading direction.
Abstract - Reader and Writer.
Concrete - InputStream and OutputStream
OutputStream - void flush() - the idea of flush is that streams may be connected to one another, and eventually they reach a certain destination, but there is this potential problem. To push data from the stream-- to guarantee that it actually goes through-- you have the method flush. Normally, the flush occurs automatically when you close the stream. But what if you don't want to close the stream just yet, and you want to continue writing, and yet so far, what you've written to the stream-- you just want to make sure it actually reaches the other end-- reaches the destination. So that's why you might wish to call the method flush.

## Basic Binary Data Reading and Writing

```java
try (InputStream in = new FileInputStream("some.xyz");
     OutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("other.xyz");) {
    byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
    int length = 0;
    while ((length = in.read(buffer)) != -1) {
        out.write(buffer,0,length);
    }
} catch (IOException e) { /* ... */ }
```

## Basic Character Data Reading and Writing

```java
Charset utf8 = Charset.forName("UTF-8");
try (Reader in = new FileReader("some.txt", utf8);
     Writer out = new FileWriter("other.txt", utf8);) {
    char[] buffer = new char[1024];
    int length = 0;
    while ((length = in.read(buffer)) != -1) {
        out.write(buffer,0,length);
    }
} catch (IOException e) { /* ... */ }
```

## Connecting Streams

You may wish to read information from a source which is in one format, but then you may wish to transfer that data through a series of streams until you get a different format, or until you get some convenience methods that you prefer to use. Same with writing.

```java
Charset utf8 = Charset.forName("UTF-8");
try (BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new FileInputStream("some.txt"), utf8));
     PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream("other.txt"), utf8));) {
    char[] buffer = new char[1024];
    String line = null;
    while ((line = in.readLine()) != null) {    // null indicates the end of stream
        out.println(line);
    }
} catch (IOException e) { /* ... */ }
```

It allows me to read the file line by line, rather than deal with the char buffer.

## Standard Input and Output

**System.in** represents the input direction on a console,
**System.out** represents the output direction,
**System.error** represents the standard error output

```java
public class Echo {
    public class void main (String[] args) {
        Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
        String txt = null;
        System.out.println("To quit type: exit");
        System.out.println("Type value and press enter:");
        while (!(txt = s.nextLine()).equals("exit")) {
            System.out.println("Echo: "+txt);
        }
    }
}
```



# Part 2

## Using Console

java.io.Console

```java
public class Echo {
    public class void main (String[] args) {
        Console c = System.console();
        if (c == null) {
            System.out.println("Console is not supported");
            return;
        }
        PrintWriter out = c.writer();
        out.println("To quit type: exit");
        out.println("Type value and press enter:");
        String txt = null;
        while (!(txt = c.readLine()).equals("exit")) {
            out.println("Echo: "+txt);
        }
    }
}
```

**readPassword()** - then when a user process the character on a console-- on a keyboard. And it's not actually E-code to the console. The user doesn't see what been typed.

## Understand Serialization

Purpose:
1.Serialization is a process of writing objects from memory into a stream;
2.Deserialization is a process of reading objects from the stream;
3.Data is serialized in a binary form.

One thing that this process is not suitable for is long-term data storage-- categorically not.

## Serializable Object Graph

java.io.Serializable - interface is used to indicate **premission to serialize instances of a class**.
Serialization includes the entire object graph, except **transient** variables.
If you're trying to serialize an object that does not implement serializable interface, you'll get an exception. It's a marker interface.

## Object Serialization

**ObjectOutputStream** writes serializable object to a stream.
**ObjectInputStream** reads serialization object from a stream.
ClassNotFoundException - Because you're trying to do something which is not matching the way that was written.

## Serialization of Sensitive Information

Creating a message digest(digerir).

```java
public String generateHash(Object obj) NoSuchAlgorithmException, IOException {
    String hash = null;
    try (ByteArrayOutputStream byteArrayStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
         ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(byteArrayStream)) {
        MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
        out.writeObject(obj);
        hash = new BigInteger(1, md.digest(byteArrayStream.toByteArray())).toString(16);
    }
    return hash;
}
```

## Customize Serialization Process

method **writeObject** performs custom actions when serializing this object;
method **readObject** performs custom actions when deserializing this object;
These methods must use _private_.

## Serialization and Versioning

And what will happen in the serialization-deserialization process is that ObjectInput and ObjectOutputStreams will actually look at that data. And they will check if current version of the class you currently have in your class path matches previously serialized version that is coming from the stream.

```java
public class Product implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    // code
}
```



# Part 3

## Working with Filesystems

java.nio.file       (java.io.File legacy API)
class **Path** represents files and folders
class **Files** gets you operations that you could use to handle path objects.
class **FileSystem** represents the overall filesystem.

```java
FileSystem fs = FileSystems.getDefault();
fs.getFileStores().forEach(s->System.out.println(s.type()+' '+s.name)));
fs.getRootDirectories().forEach(p->System.out.println(p));
String separator = fs.getSeparator();
```

## Constructing Filesystem Paths

```java
Path someFile = Path.of("/","users","joe","docs","some.txt");       //  /users/joe/docs/some.txt
Path justSomeFile = someFile.getFileName();                         //  some.txt
Path docsFolder = someFile.getParent();                             //  /users/joe/docs
Path currentFolder = Path.of(".");                                  //  assuming "." is /users/joe
Path acmeFile = docsFolder.resolve("../pics/acme.jpg");             //  /users/joe/docs/../pics/acme.jpg
Path otherFile = someFile.resolveSibling("other.txt");              //  /users/joe/docs/other.txt
Path normalisedAcmeFile = acmeFile.normalize();                     //  /users/joe/pics/acme.jpg
Path verifiedPath = acmeFile.toRealPath();
Path betweenSomeAndAcme = someFile.relativize(acmeFile);            //  ../../pics/acme.jpg
```

## Navigating the Filesystem

```java
Path joe = Path.of("/","users","joe");
Path p1 = Path.of("/","users","joe","docs","some.txt");
for (int i=0; i<p1.getNameCount(); i++) {
    Path p = p1.getName(i);                                         //  sequence of path elements
}
Path p2 = Path.of("./pics/s.txt");
Files.createSymbolicLink(p2, p1);                                   //  p2 point to some.txt file
Files.list(joe).forEach(p->System.out.println(p));                  //  /users/joe/docs/
                                                                    //  /users/joe/pics/

Files.walk(joe).map(p->p.toString())                                //  /users/joe/docs/some.txt
                .filter(s->s.endsWith("txt"))                       //  /users/joe/docs/other.txt
                .forEach(p->System.out.println(p));                 //  /users/joe/pics/s.txt
Path p3 = Files.readSymbolicLink(p2);
```



# Part 4

## Class Files

Apparently, the first part of this chapter that tells you you have to open the stream to read from the file, do the loop, read the line. Actually, there is Files.lines method that just does it for you. It gives you stream of lines.
**Files.delete(path)** -- you can't delete a non-empty directory.

## Handle Zip Archives

**ZipInputStremas** and **ZipOutputStremas**

## Access HTTP Resources

```java
Path path = Path.of("docs", "index.html");
URI uri = URI.create("http://openjdk.java.net"):
HttpRequest req = HttpRequest.newBuilder(uri).GET().build();
HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
HttpResponse<Path> res = client.send(req, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofFile(path));
```
