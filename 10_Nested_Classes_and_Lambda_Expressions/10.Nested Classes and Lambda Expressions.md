# Part 1

## Types of Nested(aninhadas) Classes

There are different types of nested classes, but what's common between all of these types is that they represent cases when one class is written inside another.
Reason ? Is because you want to constrain the context in which it is used. You don't want the code to be reused everywhere.
**Static nested class** is associated with the _static context_ of the outer class.
**Member inner class** is associated with an _instance context_ of the outer class.
**Local inner class** is associated with the context of specific method.
**Anonymous inner class** is an inline implementation or extension of an interface or a class.

## Static Nested Classes

```java
public class Order {
    public static void createShippingMode(String description) {
        new ShippingMode(description);
    }
    private static class ShippingMode {
        private String description;
        public ShippingMode(String description) {
            this.description = description;
        }
        //  other methods
    }
}
```

We're trying to say that shipping mode is something that only is used by orders. Nothing else in our application uses that shipping mode. It's only valid in the context of the order.
So static, nested classes, or any nested classes, actually, can access the code of the outer class directly. However, **you only see static methods and static variables of the order**.

## Member Inner Classes

```java
public class Order {
    private Set<Item> items = new HashSet<>();
    public void addItem(Product product, int quantity) {
        items.add(new Item(product, quantity));
    }
    class Item {
        private Product product;
        private int quantity;
        private Item(Product product, int quantity) {
            this.product = product;
            this.quantity = quantity;
        }
        //  other methods
    }
}
```

By placing an item class as a member inner class into the order, you're essentially saying you have to instantiate the order first. You have to have an instance of the order.
The class item can see instance variables and instance methods of the order. You can even if they're private, actually. And it can see static variables and methods of the order even if they're private.

## Local Inner Classes

Extremely rare!
So this is kind of a situation when the class is declared inside a method.

```java
public class Order {
    private Map<Integer, Item> items = new HashSet<>();
    public void manageTax(final String saleLocation) {
        class OrderTaxManager {
            private BigDecimal findRate(Product product) {
                //  use saleLocation and product to find the tax rate
            }
            BigDecimal calculateTax() {
                //  find tax rate in a given sale location for each product
                //  calculate tax value
            }
        }
        OrderTaxManager taxManager = new OrderTaxManager();
        BigDecimal taxTotal = taxManager.calculateTax();
    }
}
```

Reason (maybe) ? It might be like a security concern, or a very tight restriction imposed upon your code.
However, there is a restriction. Variables that you want to observe from outside of the orderTaxManager-- so the code inside this class can see variables outside if they're **final** or **effectively final**.
**Effectively final** is a concept in Java that basically allows the compiler to figure out if you never reassign the variable.

## Anonymous Inner Classes

The most common type of inner class!
Represents is an inline implementation of an interface or extension of the class.

```java
public class Order {
    public BigDecimal getDiscount() {
        return BigDecimal.ZERO;
    }
}
```

Anonymous Inner Class Implementation:

```java
Order order = new Order() {
    @Override
    public BigDecimal getDiscount() {
        return BigDecimal.valueOf(0.1);
    }
}
```

Another example:

```java
List<Product> products = ...;
Collections.sort(products, new Comparator<Product>() {
    public int compare(Product p1, Product p2) {
        return p1.getName().compareTo(p2.getName());
    }
});
```


## Understand Lambda Expressions

Invocation context:

```java
List<Product> products = ...;
Collections.sort(products, <Comparator>);
```

**What does the compiler know about this scenario?** When a compiler looks at this chunk of code, the compiler understands that a collection is using _generics Product_ in this particular case, the compiler knows that the _first parameter of the source method_ is the collection you would like to sort, and it understands what is the type of the object in that collection-- that its product.And then compile also understands that the second parameter is a comparator interface.

Anonymous inner class:

```java
Collections.sort(products, new Comparator<Product>() {
    public int compare(Product p1, Product p2) {
        return p1.getName().compareTo(p2.getName());
    }
});
```

_Comparator_ is a functional interface - only one method.
Lambda operator: **->** (like an arrow funciton in JS).
Lambda expressions are often referred to as a functional programming style:

```java
Collections.sort(products, (p1, p2) -> p1.getPrice().compareTo(p2.getPrice()) );
```



# Part 2

## Define Lambda Expression Parameters and Body

If you want to use additional modifiers, it's just syntactically required to imply the type explicitly,

```java
list.removeIf( (final var s) -> s.equals("remove me") );
```

```java
list.sort( (s1, s2) -> { return s1.compareTo(s2); }; );
```

## Use Method References

```java
public class TextFilter {
    public static boolean removeA(String s) {
        return s.equals("remove A");
    }
    public int sortText(String s1, String s2) {
        return s1.compareTo(s2);
    }
}
```

```java
list.removeIf(TextFilter::removeA);                   //  list.removeIf(s -> TextFilter.removeA(s));
Collection.sort(list, filter::sortText);              //  Collection.sort(list, (s1, s2) -> filter.sortText(s1, s2));
Collection.sort(list, String::compareToIgnoreCase);   //  Collection.sort(list, (s1, s2) -> s1.compareToIgnoreCase(s2));
```
